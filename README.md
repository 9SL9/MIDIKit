# üéπ MIDIKit

[![CI Build Status](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Platforms - macOS 10.12+ | iOS 10+ (beta)](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-macOS%2010.12%2B%20|%20iOS%2010%2B-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift) [![License: MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/blob/main/LICENSE)

An elegant and modern Swift CoreMIDI wrapper with:

- strongly-typed protocol-agnostic MIDI events
  - (ie: a single 'note on' event & its value types are homogenous between MIDI 1.0 and 2.0)
- event filters
  - easily filter or drop events by message type, channel, CC number, UMP group, and more
- seamless unified API, transparently adopting newer Core MIDI API and MIDI 2.0 on platforms that support them

## MIDIKit Extensions

Abstractions are built as optional extensions in their own repos.

- [MIDIKitControlSurfaces](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKitControlSurfaces): MIDIKit extension for Control Surfaces (HUI, etc.)
- [MIDIKitSync](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKitSync): MIDIKit extension for sync (MTC, etc.)
- [MIDIKitSMF](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKitSMF): MIDIKit extension for reading/writing Standard MIDI Files (SMF)
