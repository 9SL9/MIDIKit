# üéπ MIDIKit

[![CI Build Status](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Platforms - macOS 10.12+ | iOS 10+ | tvOS (beta) | watchOS (beta)](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-macOS%2010.12%2B%20|%20iOS%2010%2B%20|%20tvOS%20(beta)%20|%20watchOS%20(beta)-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift) [![License: MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit/blob/main/LICENSE)

An elegant and modern Swift CoreMIDI wrapper with:

- strongly-typed protocol-agnostic MIDI events
  - (ie: a single 'note on' event & its value types are homogenous between MIDI 1.0 and 2.0)
- event filters
  - easily filter or drop events by message type, channel, CC number, UMP group, and more
- seamless unified API across **macOS 10.12 Sierra** and later (including **macOS 12.0 Monterey**)
- seamless unified API across **iOS 10** and later (including **iOS 15**)
- beta support for **tvOS** and **watchOS** in development

Back-porting a limited subset of MIDI 2.0 features to older platforms (macOS Catalina or older, and iOS 13 or older) is planned, but not yet supported.

## MIDIKit Extensions

Abstractions are built as optional extensions in their own repos.

- [MIDIKitSync](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKitSync): MIDIKit extension for sync (MTC, etc.)
