    /// "Use of Active Sensing is optional for either receivers or transmitters. This byte (`0xFE`) is sent every 300 ms (maximum) whenever there is no other MIDI data being transmitted. If a device never receives Active Sensing it should operate normally. However, once the receiver recognizes Active Sensing (`0xFE`), it then will expect to get a message of some kind every 300 milliseconds. If no messages are received within this time period the receiver will assume the MIDI cable has been disconnected for some reason and should turn off all voices and return to normal operation. It is recommended that transmitters transmit Active Sensing within 270ms and receivers judge at over 330ms leaving a margin of roughly 10%."
