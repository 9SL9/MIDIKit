	/// A type-erased box to contain a type that conforms to the `MIDI.IO.Object` and `MIDI.IO.ObjectRef` protocols.
	///
	/// When creating a variable or collection that can store any `MIDI.IO` object, using `MIDI.IO.ObjectRef` protocol as the type will allow storage of the objects and expose the properties protocolized by `MIDI.IO.ObjectRef`, but the protocol is not implicitly `Hashable` or `Identifiable` because these introduce Self requirements which would reduce the contexts in which it can be used.
	///
	/// To that end, the sister protocol `MIDI.IO.Object` exposes conformance to `Hashable` or `Identifiable` but at a cost of not having implicit properties exposed.
	///
	/// When `Hashable`/`Identifiable` conformance and object properties are required, `AnyMIDIObject` is provided as a box to contain `MIDI.IO` objects which meets both criteria.
	///
	/// - Warning: It is recommended to only use this to box objects that originate from MIDIKit.
