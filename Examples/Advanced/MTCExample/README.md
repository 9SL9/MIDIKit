# MTC Example

This project demonstrates both MTC generation and chase (receive).

### Usage

This demo does not feed back into itself - it is meant to interact with a DAW that supports MTC (Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, etc.) or MTC-compatible hardware.

- Use the MTC Generator window to transmit MTC messages to a DAW and have the DAW chase it.

- Use the MTC Receiver window to receive MTC messages from a DAW and display the timecode being received.
