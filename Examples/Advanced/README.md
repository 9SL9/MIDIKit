# Advanced Examples

The examples in this folder are for advanced users and may involve suboptimal hacks or workarounds - thus, they are not expressly designed to be learning examples.

These were also initially used for debugging and as testbed applications while developing MIDIKit.

These examples may be refined and cleaned up in future.
