# MIDIKit Examples

These example projects are provided as a springboard to getting started with MIDIKit, and demonstrate best practises for working with MIDI services on Apple platforms.

Examples are provided for each supported platform, as optimal implementation details may vary.

## Troubleshooting

- ⚠️ If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
- ⚠️ When building for a physical iOS device or MacCatalyst, you must select your Team ID in the app target's code signing.
